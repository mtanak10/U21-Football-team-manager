## Football player's fitness tracker for the university team manager

A football team's management application to make the managers decision easy and more accurate. It lets you get the information about the player's fitness and condition right before the match so that it is easy for the manager to choose the right players to play for the weekend's match. Possible features incldue a visible comparison of the fitness of players that are in the same position so that it is easier for the coach to make a right decision. X could be the players and different positions and Y could be the list of players in the team or the list of players in the same position this could be done using the position class to group players as well. This application will include multiple factors that will help the decision of a coach. *For example if the player went out to drink before the game or if the player trained (eg going for a run)individually that week.* These could be tracked through boolean fields such as *"wentDrinking"* or *"attendedTraining"*. This project is intended to be used in the UBC football team (non varsity team) that I play for. It is not often people do not show up or goes to drink the day before the game. It is very hard for the coach to make a informed decision on who to be picked. **I want to make the decision for the coach easy and fast so that the team and the player who is ready benefits a lot.**
