## Football player's fitness tracker for the university team manager

A football team's management application to make the managers decision easy and more accurate. It lets you get the information about the player's fitness and condition right before the match so that it is easy for the manager to choose the right players to play for the weekend's match. Possible features incldue a visible comparison of the fitness of players that are in the same position so that it is easier for the coach to make a right decision. X could be the players and different positions and Y could be the list of players in the team or the list of players in the same position this could be done using the position class to group players as well. This application will include multiple factors that will help the decision of a coach. *For example if the player went out to drink before the game or if the player trained (eg going for a run)individually that week.* These could be tracked through boolean fields such as *"wentDrinking"* or *"attendedTraining"*. This project is intended to be used in the UBC football team (non varsity team) that I play for. It is not often people do not show up or goes to drink the day before the game. It is very hard for the coach to make a informed decision on who to be picked. **I want to make the decision for the coach easy and fast so that the team and the player who is ready benefits a lot.**

**Phase 4: Task 3** 

If I had more time to work on the project, one refactoring that I would have implemented for Graphical User Interface which had a lot of repeated process such as addition of submit buttons and cancel buttons. This was a process that was needed for all 7 or 8 frames that I made in the ui that I made. However, I was not able to refactor them and I had to implement the creation of submit button for each cases and this made me write a lot of repetitive code. This was one thing that I would be changing for refactoring.If I had more time I would aslo add a feature to classify each players with their age and their positions. This would enable players to be viewed easier and would be better for the user to make a choice on what player would be good to play. These could lead to a creation of the recommendation system on who to play based on their status and evaluation.
